# Reinforcement Learning Agent for Crew of One

As the title suggests, this is a Machine Learning agent build to play the game "Crew of One". The original game was made by a team including myself for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam. I have since made some adaptations to interface with the ML Agent. The agent is built in python using the Keras libraries. The model is using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorythm to learn a policy over a couple thousand lives in "Crew of One"

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
